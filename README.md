# EmployeeScheduler
Employee Scheduler for when the business has Full and Part Time Employees

When there are Full and Part time employees in a business scheduling can take up to 4 hours each and every time a schedule is created. The Employee Scheduler is being designed to ease the burden of scheduling.

The Employee Scheduler will take information from Managers or Trusted Administrators regarding store hours and requirements, employee scheduling, and Section Information and use it to create a schedule for schedulers to follow. The scheduler will then be able to take the information provided and fill in the blanks of the daily/weekly calender.
